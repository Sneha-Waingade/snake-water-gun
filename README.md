# 🐍 Snake Water Gun - Python Mini Project

This is a simple Python game based on the classic *Snake-Water-Gun* logic (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors), built using basic control flow and random module. Perfect for Python beginners!

## 💡 How It Works
- The user picks one of the three: 
  - 🐍 `1` for Snake
  - 🔫 `0` for Gun
  - 💧 `-1` for Water
- The computer randomly picks one too.
- Based on the rules, the game declares a winner:
  - Snake drinks Water ➡️ Snake wins
  - Gun kills Snake ➡️ Gun wins
  - Water ruins Gun ➡️ Water wins
  - Same choices = Draw
